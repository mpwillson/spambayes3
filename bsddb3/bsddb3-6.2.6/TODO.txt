* 20161120: Document how to install with alternative Berkeley DB paths
  using PIP.

* 20160422: The "changelog" should merge with the sphynx documentation.

* 20160421: Merge "README.txt" with the sphynx documentation.

* 20131204: Rewrite "make3.py".

* 20080327: Add a parameter to DBEnv.log_flush().

* 20080402: If a prepared/recovered transaction is garbaged collected,
  we leak transactions. Can we call "discard" in a safe way?.

* 20080403: If an exception is raised in a thread in the TestSuite, we
  pass the test. Bad!.

* 20080403: Write a test for MVCC.

* 20080403: We should recreate the test data directory in every
  execution, and delete it when finished.

* 20080403: "txn_stat" provides a list of active transactions. Export it
  to Python.

* 20080426: Verify that "DB_ENV->set_event_notify" follows the API.

* 20080521: Write a test for "DB_ENV->set_rpc_server". This test would be
  called if there is a concrete environment variable defined, for example.

* 20080522: Think about changing the library name to "berkeleydb". See
  http://mailman.jcea.es/pipermail/pybsddb/2008-March/000019.html

* 20080522: Update the "README.txt" document.

* 20080531: "DB_ENV->rep_set_limit" and "DB_ENV->rep_get_limit", support
  for long values.

* 20080629: The testsuite implements a "test_support" module, used when
  the underlying python version doesn't have it. Because a bug in the
  test code, this version is used always, even if this python version
  has "test_support". This is actually useful, because current test
  code uses features in "test_support" that are not available in
  previous python versions.

* 20080720: The test for crash documented in http://bugs.python.org/issue3307
  is disabled because it prints a error message to screen. Solve this and
  reenable the test. This would require "set_errfile" implementation.

* 20080811: "DB.has_key()" must be retained in python3.0, since it allows
  a transaction parameter.

* 20080812: "DBEnv.db_home", under python3.0, is automatically converted
  to bytes. What charset is used?.

* 20080812: Since Python 3.0 dropped the "cmp" function in "sort()"
  methods, we need to handcode some "Insertion sort" functions, in
  the testsuite and in the production code. This is ugly and slow.

* 20080812: "test_all.do_proxy_db_py3k()" is a very ugly hack. For
  example, if a test fails, it can leave the testsuite in an
  inconsistent state, causing spurious failures.

* 20080812: We use "getattr()" to avoid "obj.next()" automatic
  conversion via "2to3" tool. Improve this.

* 20080812: Python 3.0 idioms available in 2.6 and up should be
  used also in this versions.

* 20080813: Create a "__contains__" routine in DB, etc, to use
  when 2to3 tools translate "has_key" to "in".

* 20080813: We use "getattr()" to avoid "obj.has_key()" automatic
  conversion via "2to3" tool. Improve this, specially in
  "dbtables.py".

* 20080813: We can store "None" values in a database. How can we
  differenciate between stored "None" and NotFound?. We can
  use exceptions or the "default" parameter, but... this is ugly.

* 20080813: TO INVESTIGATE (posible bug in Berkeley DB): if you
  duplicate a duplicated cursor, crash.

* 20080813: The put_bytes/get_bytes technique in "dbtables" is
  nice, but the "getattr" method is not. The problem is that
  DB objects can't grow new attributes. Solve this.

* 20080814: If pybsddb classes would be subclassed, we could
  implement conversion methods for keys and values in
  a very elegant way. This is specially relevant in Python 3.0.

  When done, delete "StringValues" and "StringKeys" in
  Python native "test_bsddb.py".

* 20080814: If we could subclass the bsddb objects, we could
  drop "dbobj.py" (a bit outdated by now).

* 20080918: If "DB_close_internal()" fails in "DB_verify()", we
  should close the DB handle.

* 20080929: Support "master leases". Beware bug
  http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?forumID=272&threadID=708324

* 20081011: Evaluate support of "with" statement for things like
  transactions.

* 20081013: Evaluate convenience of returning named tuples in some places.

* 20081013: Evaluate convenience of supporting "sys.getsizeof()".

* 20081013: Port "PyModule_AddStringMacro" and "PyModule_AddIntMacro"
  when compiling for old versions of Python.

* 20090121: In the "associate()" callback, there are mallocs to
  contain the "data" portion of DBT's. Test that they are correctly
  freed by Berkeley DB.

* 20090121: If somethings goes wrong in the "associate()" callback,
  we are going to leak memory and coredump. Solve it.

* 20090121: If the "associate()" callback returns an empty list, crash.

* 20090121: "DB->compact()" should return more data to the caller.

* 20090204: "txn->stat()" returns also a list of active transactions.
  Evaluate if we must export that data to python.

* 20090204: A lot of binding functions allow optional parameters, but
  not keyword ones. Normalize this.

* 20090204: "rep_set_limit()" and "rep_get_limit()" only manages "bytes",
  not gigabytes.

* 20090423: Evaluate convenience of supporting DTrace.

* 20090427: Split base replication and replication manager
  documentation in documents separated of DBENV docs.

* 20090427: "__contains__()" is not transactionally protected. This is
  a problem. Maybe we should raise an exception to avoid the usage
  of patterns like "if key in DB", not transactionally protected.
  Think about this.

* 20090428: Support DB_MULTIPLE and DB_MULTIPLE_KEY.

* 20090630: "README.txt" needs some love.

* 20090723: Add encryption tests.

* 20091105: Check if the "from unittest.runner import _TextTestResult"
  trick in Python 2.7 and 3.2 development versions are still necessary.

* 20091112: Update documentation links to Oracle site.

* 20091112: DBEnv->set_flags() must support True/False.

* 20091206: Review ALL documentation, text and comments in code.

* 20100111: If "DB_ENV->set/get_mp_mmapsize()" is 32 bits in
  64 bits architecture, it is not going to be enough.

* 20100112: Currently we increment refcounts of the parent
  objects. These can keep parent objects around, so better
  allow GC of them to close the entire object tree.

* 20100112: LogCursors should be iterable.

* 20100112: "DBEnv->log_file()" use an iterative method to
  calculate the space. Improve it.

* 20100217: When a "Lock" is garbage collected, we leak it
  and we do not release it.

* 20100318: Iterate keys in dbshelve load all keys in memory first.

* 20100318: Implement "__iter__()" in DB, maybe thru a DBCursor.

* 20100319: Cursors in dbtables should be iterable.

* 20100406: Document in the manual the use of the C API.

* 20100406: The "_bsddb"/"_pybsddb" import renaming should go away.

* 20100429: "setuptools" should work correctly under Python 3 (PYPI).

* 20100908: Use PEP 384: "Defining a Stable ABI", when approved.

* 20100917: Review and update all documentation.

* 20100917: Some errors are exported as integer values, beside the
  proper exception. For instance, DB_SECONDARY_BAD. Evaluate if it
  is convenient or not.

* 20120116: After dropping Python 2.3 support, some integers
  returned should be promoted to "unsigned integers". Same with
  input values.
