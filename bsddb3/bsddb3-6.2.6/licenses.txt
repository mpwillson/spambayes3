The history of this project is long and complicated, and so are
their copyrights and licenses. I (Jesus Cea) write this document
in orden to clarify the situation.

This code was integrated once in Python 2.x, so I guess somebody
did the paperwork related to contributor agreement. This code is
derived from that version, so that could be a license
checkpoint/blank sheet. I must verify that.

New files will be covered by the 3-clause BSD license.
